### Summary

I am currently a mentee of popular Youtuber Andy Sterkowitz, a self taught developer. I am new to the program and was tasked to create a simple digital counter. The styling of the clock is intentionally limited. The clock uses the JS date object and pulls several parameters in order to make a properly formatted date.
